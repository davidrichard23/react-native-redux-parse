This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

I created this template to help expidite the proccess of creating a user account based React Native app using Redux and [Parse Server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) for the backend.

It primarily uses [Parse-Lite](https://github.com/andrewimm/parse-lite) but also needs the official [Parse JS SDK](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-JS) for certain things like Live Query and File uploads

It also uses [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation)

## Getting Started

To get started, all you need to do is clone this repo, run npm install, and update ``config.json`` with your Parse Server host and App ID
